# Contributing Data
You must be a `Certified User` to contribute data to Synapse. You are responsible for determining if the data you would like to contribute is `Controlled Use` and therefore requires `Conditions for Use`. Carefully consider the specific risks and appropriate protections required before sharing your data. 

If there are no ethical, legal or regulatory reasons to impose `Conditions for Use`, the data can be used for any lawful research purpose. All human data shared in Synapse, with or without `Conditions for Use`, must be de-identified according to **HIPAA standards** and comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Guidance on de-identification according to HIPAA rules can be found [here](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy){:target="_blank"}. 

`Conditions for Use` can be set at the `Project`, `Folder`, or `File`/`Table` level. We recommend grouping `Files` that require the same `Conditions for Use` in a dedicated `Folder` within your `Project`. For more information about setting `Conditions for Use` please see [Access Controls and Data Governance](/articles/access_controls.html).

# Accessing Data

Both `Registered` and `Certified` users can view, download, and use `Open Data` (data that does not have `Conditions for Use`.)

## How do you access data with Conditions for Use? 

To access `Controlled Data` (data with `Conditions for Use`), you must fulfill the `Conditions for Use` set by the data contributor. On the specific `File`/`Table's` page, click on the orange `Show unmet conditions` box in the center of the header. This will open a dialog box with directions on how to meet the `Conditions for Use` for the `File`/`Table` (see example, below). In many cases, access requires that you read and agree to data-specific terms electronically in a clickwrap contract. Occasionally, access to `Controlled Data` requires additional steps, like having your analysis plan approved by an ethics board or IRB.

Each Synapse user wishing to access `Controlled Data` must individually agree to the `Conditions for Use` to access that data.

## Accessing Bridge Data

Synapse houses Bridge data, data collected through research apps. This data has been donated by thousands of volunteers 
from around the world. Bridge data is only accessible to Users with a `Validated Profile`. To learn more see [Synapse User Credentials](/articles/accounts_certified_users_and_profile_validation.html#validated-profile).

Each Synapse user wishing to access Bridge data must individually agree to the `Conditions for Use`.

## Flagging Inappropriate Data Use
Any human data shared in Synapse, with or without `Conditions for Use`, must be de-identified according to HIPAA Standards and 
all applicable privacy laws and regulations [see [Contributing Data](#contributing-data), above]. **If you believe data made available in Synapse has been posted with inappropriate `Conditions for Use` contact the ACT at <mailto:act@sagebase.org> or click on the `Report Issue` flag (found at the center of the header). This will trigger an email to the ACT who will contact you for more details.**
