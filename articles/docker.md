# Synapse Docker Registry

Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run.  This can be extremely helpful as software can have many dependencies, so by installing all of them in a container, users can avoid going through the trouble of installing the software on their own computer.  These Docker images can then be stored and distributed on a Docker registry.  The Synapse Docker registry will allow users to create software on a per project basis which can be easily shared across Synapse. Use the  links to learn more about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview){:target="_blank"} and [Docker registry](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-registry){:target="_blank"}.


## Creating a new Docker image
Let's begin by creating a custom Docker image.  Users can choose to either modify an existing Docker image or build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.  Docker images must be tagged with 'docker.synapse.org/synapseProjectId/myreponame' to allow images to be saved. 

**Tagging an existing Docker image to save onto the Synapse registry**

```
docker pull ubuntu
```

To tag an existing Docker image, users can use the IMAGE ID or the repo name.  The IMAGE ID can be found by doing:

```
docker images
#REPOSITORY	TAG	IMAGE ID	CREATED	SIZE
#ubuntu	latest	f8d79ba03c00	6 days ago	126.4 MB
```

Tag the Docker image:

```
docker tag f8d79ba03c00 docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo:version1 
#or
docker tag ubuntu:latest docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo:version1 
#syntax: docker.synapse.org/<projectId>/<repoName>:<tag>
```

You can also choose to not tag your image with an explicit tag, which will by default tag it with `latest`.

```
docker tag f8d79ba03c00 docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo
```

**Build your own image from a Dockerfile**
When building a Docker image from a Dockerfile simply add a `-t` to the docker build command with the correct Synapse Docker registry tag.

```
docker build -t  docker.synapse.org/syn12345/my-repo path/to/dockerfile
```

## Storing Docker images in the Synapse Docker Registry
To store Docker images, use the `docker push` command.  To push to the Synapse Docker Registry, users must be logged into the registry:

```
docker login docker.synapse.org
#Username: (Input Synapse username)
#Password: 
#Login Succeeded 
```

After logging in, view your images and decide which ones to push into the registry.

```
docker images
#REPOSITORY                                 TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
#docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo   version1            f8d79ba03c00        6 days ago          126.4 MB
#ubuntu                                     latest              f8d79ba03c00        6 days ago          126.4 MB
#docker.synapse.org/syn12345/my-repo	latest	df323sdf123d	2 days ago	200.3 MB
docker push docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo:version1
docker push docker.synapse.org/syn12345/my-repo
```

## Using Docker images stored in the Synapse Docker Registry
To access the Docker images stored in Synapse, simply use the `docker pull` command.

```
docker pull docker.synapse.org/syn12345/my-repo
#By default, if you do not specify a tag, it will attach "latest" as the tag.  If you specified a tag on your repository, be sure to pull the repository with the tag.
docker pull docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo:version1
```

Docker tags can be assigned to later commits. If you want to be explicit about the version of an image then instead of referencing a tag you can reference a digest:

```
docker pull docker.synapse.org/syn12345/mytestrepo@sha256:2e36829f986351042e28242ae386913645a7b41b25844fb39b29af0bdf8dcb63
```

where the digest for a commit is printed to the command line after a successful Docker push. The Synapse web portal displays current digests for a repository's tags on the repository's Synapse page.
